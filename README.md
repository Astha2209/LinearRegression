# Linear Regression

In this repository, I work with insurance data set to predict the losses by performing linear regression on this dataset. Shown below is a brief description of the variables used:

Policy_Num      : Policy Number
Age             : Age of the driver
Years_Drv_Exp   : Number of years of driving experience
Number_Vehicles : Number of vehicles owned
Gender          : Gender
Married         : Married or Unmarried 
Vehicle_Age     : Age of the Vehicle
Fuel_Type       : Gas or Diesel
Losses          : Losses occurred 

I use R to build a prediction model to predict the losses for the insurance company.
